<h2>Minh's feedback:</h2>
<h3>Nicholas Massouridis</h3>
<p>It is unfortunate that Paco left our group due to his cancelation on the course,
his job on the group was to interview an IT professional. It would be a huge lost
for if this part could not be done but luckily for us that Nick was there to save
the day and do this part for us before he even have time to finish his own work.
In addition, he also finish his work very early and able to help the others on 
doing their part.</p>
<h3>Liam Conrad</h3>
<p>Liam is the team leader for the group, he was a great leader with good leadership 
skill and very helpful on everything. As a member of the team, he did manage to 
complete every task assigned to him as well as managing every meeting session. On 
the other word, without him, we might not have that at least two team meeting a week
and the project would be more difficult to complete, I feel lucky that this guy is in 
the team.</p>
<h3>Prottay Karim</h3>
<p>My impression on this guy is not as much as the other but he did a great job in 
completing every single tasks assigned. In addition, he also covered Paco's part to 
write about an IT technology.</p>
<h3>Tran Gia Luat Ung</h3>
<p>He missed two team meetings due to some personal reasons and his contribution 
on the team is very little. However, he always completed every assigned task very 
early even though sometime he still struggling to push his work on github.</p>
