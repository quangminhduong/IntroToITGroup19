<li>Name: Quang Minh Duong</li>
<li>Student ID: 3759757</li>
<li>Email address: s3759757@student.rmit.edu.au</li>
<li>Background info: I come from Danang, Vietnam, I’m 20 years old. I completed my A-level degree in Vietnam two years ago and I 
just came to Melbourne to study abroad last year. I can speak two languages, which is Vietnamese and English, I’m also study the 
third language, which is Mandarin at this moment. Other than IT, I also have a hobby about soccer, play computer games and 
research about history.</li>
<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<ul>
<li>In IT, I find that security is the most interesting area for me. It probably started around 2014 when I watch the movie The 
Imitation Game, which is about a British computer scientist who has managed to crack Enigma, a German encryption device during
World War 2 and shorten the length of the war by two years. As I already mention that I also have an interest on history 
researching so this movie really inspired me about IT in general and security in particular.</li>
<li>I have studied a bit of IT during my secondary school and then computer science during my A-level degree</li>
<li>I chose RMIT because of the reputation and influence from my sister who has graduated from RMIT several years ago. I believe 
that RMIT would provide the best environment for me to study and achieve a good career with the Bachelor of IT degree. </li>
<li>I would expect my first year to study generally about IT like the basic of programming, database and networking, which shouldn’t
 be a huge problem for me. From second year, everything would be much harder since I must choose a minor and some advanced elective 
 courses if I want to go deeper into security.</li>

<h3>My test result evaluation:</h3>
<p> I’ve took 3 tests and 2 of them is about my personality, I can see that the result is pretty accurate, and I was amazed when it able to show some of 
my strength and weakness that I barely notice about so that I can use it to improve myself. In addition, this result will show me what kind of person I 
can be friend with. Also, my learning style test result stated out that I am a tactile learner, which mean that I learn better with real-life practice so 
I will take this into account when study. It is useful that the test does provide me with a lot of suitable tips for me to improve on my learning based on 
my style. However, I’m a little confused since I took 2 personality tests, but one test said that I’m a very extraverted person while the other say that I’m 
not. To make this clear, when thinking about it, depend on the case, I would say that I would be more extraverted to people that I’m interested in rather than 
people that I don’t. </p>
<p>As it is stated that I am more of a prospected person so I would quickly adapt to anything and any change. I will try and be as friendly with my new member 
as possible since this is a special case that I need to open myself to gain a good result from this.  However, I’m kind of too much to a turbulent person so I 
would be sensitive and harder to handle pressure. This is a huge challenge for me as working in a team mean working with different types of people and high 
responsibility for the works, we done to ensure excellent outcome of the group work. High responsibility will mean more pressure would be put on my shoulder so 
a bad managing of the team would result in an ineffective working from me.</p>
<p>It is obvious that I won’t be a good team leader at all since this is a position that need a high responsibility and that’s what I’m not good at but it won’t 
mean that I will be a bad team member. I think the most important thing when working in a team is that all the members must be close to each other so that we 
will be easier to cooperate. Other things that I will consider when forming the group is about managing like assign different tasks to different people based on 
what they are good at and give a deadline for it. To achieve this, I will have to complete the first step which is everyone need to know each other well enough so 
that it would be easier to assign the suitable task to suitable person. That what I would advice my team leader to do to ensure that I still help the team out without 
taking so much responsible so that I can work better on my part.</p>
