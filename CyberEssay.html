<h2>Cyber Security</h2>
<p>Cyber Security today lacks a proper definition.
With technology pushing forth and changing faster than ever before, there is a gerneal lack of up-to-date understanding on Cyber-security and which areas of the field have been researched and which ones remain overlooked or poorly understood.
<p>The field seems to suffer from a scarcity of reliable, verifiable data. This makes it challenging to define, articulate and ultimately understand the the actual problem and mitigating it.</p>
<p>The identified gaps include:</p>
<li>a lack of research into cybersecurity within the national security context</li>
<li>the governance of cybersecurity</li> 
<li>ethics and legal concerns</li> 
<p>and a number of emerging topics such as the dark web, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and quantum-related technologies.</p>
<p>The current state of cybersecurity is some what troublesome because of the poor attention paid by companies over the past years. wWrldwide spending on cybersecurity is forecasted to reach $133.7 billion in 2022 (Gartner), which is quite reasonable.
62% of businesses experienced phishing and social engineering attacks in 2018. (Cybint Solutions)
while 68% of business leaders feel their cybersecurity risks are increasing. (Accenture)
Only 5% of companies’ folders are properly protected, on average. (Varonis)
On the other hand, Data breaches exposed 4.1 billion records in the first half of 2019. (RiskBased). Among them, 71% of breaches were financially motivated and 25% were motivated by espionage.  (Verizon)
Others include: 52% of featured hacking, 28% involved malware and 32–33% included phishing or social engineering, respectively. (Verizon)
Between January 1, 2005 and April 18, 2018 there have been 8,854 recorded breaches. (ID Theft Resource Center)
While overall ransomware infections were down 52%, enterprise infections were up by 12% in 2018. (Symantec)
The top malicious email attachment types are .doc and .dot which make up 37%, the next highest is .exe at 19.5%. (Symantec)
By 2020, the estimated number of passwords used by humans and machines worldwide will grow to 300 billion. (Cybersecurity Media)</p>
<p>There has been quite a "hype" about quantum computers recently. Let us bring this "super powered" machine into the cyber security field. We use mainly 2 encryption methods in cyber security, one being symmetric encryption and the other being asymmetric enqryption. Symmetric encryption will be weakened by quantum computers, but with longer encryption keys, it can still be used. The algorithms presently used for asymmetric encryption will however, lose all their security and it is these asymmetric encryption algorithms that much of today's e-commerce, e-identities and certification management are based on. Before these quantum computers become a reality and more accessible, me must ensure that the cyber security field catches up.</p>
<!-- impact -->

<p>The potential impact of cybersecurity is on a global scale. As the world develops technologically, so too does the reliance or perhaps over-reliance of digital systems to control everyday infrastructures such as utilities(gas, water and electricity) and industrial systems, this makes it much easier for cybercriminals to attack said infrastructure, which costs money to prevent and fix. It is estimated that in 2021 cybercrime will cost the world $6 trillion annually (Cybercrime Magazine, 2018) and as technology develops so too will the cost to protect information.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is always changing. Cybersecurity has to be 1 step ahead of criminals at all times to be able to protect the information, not just of individuals, but whole countries themselves. As companies introduce different IT networks such as cloud, Internet of Things(IoT) and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), more traditional security such as firewalls become less relevant (Smith, 2019). Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly focused on the protection of the data itself rather than the protection of the system or network (Smith, 2019).  </p>
<p>Cybersecurity affects everyone, from the person sitting at home on their computer to global conglomerates that run the world and the entire world itself. This is because cybercrime is a global issue, people getting their personal information or savings stolen, is not only a concern for the individual but also the company with which that individuals information or money is stored. </p>
<p>As the prevalence of cybercrime increases, so too does the presence of cybersecurity to act as a countermeasure. What this means is that there will be jobs available in cybersecurity, there is such a high demand for cybersecurity positions to be filled, that by 2021 there will 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions and there will also be a zero percent unemployment rate within cybersecurity (Cybercrime Magazine, 2018).

<!-- on me -->
<p>My mobile phone is becoming more and more essential to me and facilitates my day-to-day activities like email, bank transactions etc. therefore it is important for me to protect all these. As an individual, I have a substantial responsibility and the same applies to those who develop the apps and platforms we use. I should me more cautious while downloading apps and browsing on the internet and spread awarness among my friends/family.

Nowadays a company's datas and information is not only accessible by the IT team. Therefore, as a future employee I should also take the responsibilty of raising awarness about Cyber Security among all staffs because training of employees on all levels will be a companies' best form of protection.</p>
