<h2>Prottay Karim</h2>
<p>I am currently studying Bachelor's of Information Technology at RMIT University. My student number is s3822620. I completed my highschool in 2019 from Wordbridge School in Bangladesh, the country where I was born and raised. I grew up in a multi cultural house where I learned to speak not only English and Bengali, but also Hindi and Urdu. I am a self taught Cinematographer, also I have been painting for over 10years now.</p>
<p>I fell in love with the internet on the very first day I got access to the Internet. I was fascinated by the colors and designs of a "webpage" that I discovered and how it interacted with every click. Whatever I wanted was just a click away from me. It was as if the 7 year old me had seen magic that day! From that day onwards my interests in IT grew stronger.
I expect to learn quite a few things from my time at RMIT. I want to learn Programming, IoT and cybersecurity.</p>
