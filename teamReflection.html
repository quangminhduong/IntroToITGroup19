<h2>Team Reflection</h2>
<p>The group I was assigned to had it's own perks. I personally believed that all the group members were hard working. We had very good communications overall. Above all, all group members had a strong zone and I will say we had a really good team leader. We could  also make one improvement. I guess we could have dedicated meeting hours set for every week. On the other hand, we had a few setbacks that include one of our members dropping out during the final week without any contribution and a huge load of assignments and exams of other courses so it was a race against time. A surprising part was that we had a diverese expertise in the group. The Project Idea, Essays and Github were all different strong zones of different members and that helped us run everything very smoothly. The best lesson I learned from forming a group is that you get to have people to fall back on in times of need and trouble. A task is always better done in a team. You get to have different perspectives on the story and get a range of expertise to make the best possible product.</p>
