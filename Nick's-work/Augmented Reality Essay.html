<h1> Augmented Reality</h1>
<p>Augmented Reality (AR) is the merging of digital elements and real-world environments to create a space where imagination can become a reality. 
    The possibilities of AR technology are only limited by imagination, however, technical limitations stand in the way of human ingenuity. 
</p>

<p>AR currently sees most of its use in more sophisticated mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. 
    AR saw a significant increase in popularity and usage in 2016 when the mobile game Pokemon Go was released, where players would run around and capture Pokemon in the real world using AR to locate them. 
    In today’s society, one of the more common uses for AR is in the usage of Snapchat and Instagram filters, changing one’s face to have anthropomorphic features such as cat or dog ears.
</p>

<p>Companies, such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, are working with AR and its technologies to develop AR glasses, similar in concept to Virtual Reality(VR) Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). 
    The user wears the AR glasses like a normal pair of glasses and can interact with 3D images within the scope of the lens, eliminating the need to have their phone out which is one the main issues with today’s AR technology because having a phone out limits the field of view in which the user can experience AR (Crespi, n.d.). 
    However AR glasses are still in the early stages of production and development and as such, are quite expensive. 
</p>

<p>AR can be used to enhance training environments and learning processes by adding interactive content, layered over a physical space. 
    Using AR can enrich the learning experience by providing an environment with extra tools at its disposal. 
    AR can also be used as a marketing strategy, adding an extra dimension to marketing experiences, allowing the possibility of increased interactivity and immersion (User, n.d.). 
    AR is extremely effective in the retail market, being able to overlay digital content over a physical platform in a store can show the customer what, for example, a piece of furniture, would look like in their home with other furniture set up (Technologies, n.d.) .
    Additionally AR can be used to enhance the tourism industry, with AR tourists can experience what a building or structure looked like in the past as well as experiencing recreations of historical events via AR simulation (Technologies, n.d.). Using geolocation in combination with AR an overlay can also be shown to tourists for vital information such as public transport routes as well as their location in case they are lost.
</p>

<p>The future of AR is indeed bright and as technology advances, so too will the use and the need for AR continue to grow alongside. 
    As mentioned previously AR glasses are a rather new, but rapidly advancing technology.  
    People will be able to play more sophisticated games or interact with them in a much more <emp>realistic</emp> way, for example playing a board game without the equipment (Marr, n.d.).   
</p>

<p>While AR is an exciting and progressive technology, it doesn’t come without its positives and negatives. 
One of the major positives is that it can be used as a tool to aid people in their jobs. 
In construction it can be used to virtually see how beams can be placed without actually placing them, creating a much safer environment for everyone working as it could prevent accidents. 
In medicine, doctors can take x-rays and overlay them onto a skeleton to see where breaks exactly are and to determine the best course of treatment(https://www.howstuffworks.com and https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-author.htm, 2018). 
While currently expensive and cumbersome, as technology advances and more money is invested into AR and its technologies, so too, like any other evolving technology, will its usage and affordability increase.
</p>

<p>The likely impact of AR could be quite significant depending on how it is implemented into real-world scenarios. 
    As technology advances, AR will most likely see increasing use in everyday life. 
    The people most affected would be people whose jobs could be replaced with AR, which could be seen as a negative as people don’t want to be losing their jobs. 
    The people that could be replaced with AR are those in the tourism industry. 
    Tour guides could be replaced with AR as some tourists may prefer to use an AR tour-guide over a real person, but the opposite could be said as well, people may also prefer a more interactive and human experience over a digital one (https://www.howstuffworks.com and https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-author.htm, 2018). 
</p>

<p>Another major concern is privacy and security. 
    It could be quite intimidating being able to point a phone at someone and find out everything about them without knowing that person or ever meeting them (https://www.howstuffworks.com and https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-author.htm, 2018). 
    Of course, people in today's age already put quite a lot of their personal information onto the internet, as such, this could be seen as a security issue. 
    If the security of AR is not strong enough it could be possible for criminals to be able to scan someone and get their personal information, which could be detrimental to the progression of AR if not dealt with. 
</p>

<p>In today’s current environment with the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of AR could be quite significant in education seeing as classrooms are currently closed. 
    Students and teachers could join a digital classroom, creating a much more human environment, instead of the one currently which is mainly video and audio.
</p>

<p>In my own daily life, I could see AR become a part of it once the technology has advanced further than it is currently and becomes more accessible. 
    The main use I see in AR is in conjunction with video games, being able to interact with digital objects is appealing as long as the price is within reason and I believe that this could take some time. 
    Another way I see myself using AR is through gatherings or meetings with either friends or work colleagues. 
    If the technology was readily available, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic, being able to not only see friends or colleagues but also interact with them in a sense, would be quite appealing. 
    As mentioned previously, being able to join a digital classroom myself and interact with a lecturer or fellow students, instead of looking at a computer screen the whole time, would do much for my sanity.
</p>

<p>This could affect my family or friends in much the same way it would affect myself. 
    The majority of my friends could play AR video games or have gatherings and meetings with their friends or colleagues. 
    My sister, who works in retail, could allow customers to try on clothes without actually having to put them on, creating a much more hygienic environment. 
</p>

<p>In conclusion, in today’s society Augmented Reality sees a lot of use in many industries and as the technology improves and becomes more readily accessible, so too will the use of Augmented Reality increase.
