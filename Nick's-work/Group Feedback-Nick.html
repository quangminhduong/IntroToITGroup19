    <h1>Liam</h1>

    <p>
        Liam was the leader of the group. I felt that Liam took on a lot of responsibilities and proved to be a good leader, making sure everyone was doing their part and checking to see if they had any issues. After Paco left he made sure that the parts that he was responsible for were taken over. I felt that he was very easy to work with.

    <h1>Protay</h1>

    <p>
        After Paco left the group, Protay and I were tasked with writing the other essay, which he did most of as I was tasked with other parts as well. I felt that Protay did very well considering the circumstances. Protay did all of the tasks that he was assigned to. I felt that he was very easy to work with.

    <h1>Quang</h1>

    <p>
        Quang was responsible for the management of the GitHub for our group as none of us had had experience using it before. Quang also assisted Liam in the other parts of the assignment. Quang did everything that was assigned to him and I’m grateful that he was there to show us how to use GitHub. I felt that he was easy to work with.

    <h1>Tran</h1>

    <p>
        Tran did one of the essays, but other than that did not contribute as much as the rest of the group. He was also absent for our last group meetings even though we had all agreed on the time. However, he did the work that was assigned to him. I felt that he was reasonably easy to work with, but he didn’t talk much in the meetings, so it’s hard to say.
